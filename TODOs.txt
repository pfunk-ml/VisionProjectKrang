TODOs:

1) [Done] check nomenclature of "world" vs "origin", and update variables accordingly (e.g. if world is published on krang_vision, then gTworld_origin, else opposite)

    The nomenclature of "world" and "origin" is not consistent.

    In globalTransforms.cpp, file

        gTworld_cam[i] = gTworld_origin*Ttemp.inverse();

    which is basically,
            gTworld_cam[i] = gTworld_origin * gTworld_cam.inverse();
        =>  gTworld_cam[i] = gTworld_origin * gTcam_world

2) [Done] move camProcess parameters to json -- done

3) [Done] look into cam resolution downsampling params
    - yes resolutions increases if the width and height are increased.
    - On increasing resolution, the viewing area decreases.

4) [low priority] fix bug in structrure packing for local camProcess messages 

5) [low priority] get ctrl+C signals working cleanly

6) [Done] Remove "marker_origin_id" and "camera_origin_id" from config.json? --removed


-------------------------

1)  Get the world set up with objects [2 orange chairs, long rect table, square table]
