Conducted By: ___ Nehchal J. ___

OBJECTIVE

    1. Find out what is the position of the global marker it assumes while calibrating. It should be (x=0, y=0, theta =0). This experiment is to confirm this assumption.

    2. The checkboard is symmetrical.

PROCEDURE

    1. Place the checkboard such that it is visible in the view of Cam0.
    2. Calibrate the camera.
    3. Replace the checkboard with the AR marker.
    4. Run camProcess and note down the transformation matrix.

    Notes: 
        1. Make sure the marker id used is in config.json file.
        2. Remember to change configuration settings corresponding to checkboard or marker during calibration and camProcess execution.

OBSERVATIONS

    x: __ -15.4 cms __
    y: __ 20 cms __
    theta: __ 1.52 radians __

RESULTS

    The centre of the marker is tracked.
