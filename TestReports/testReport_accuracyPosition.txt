Conducted By: ___ Nehchal J. __  

OBJECTIVE

    1. Test the accuracy of position given by camProcess.

SETUP
    
    The camera is mounted from the roof facing downwards. 
        Camera: __ Logitech WebCam 9000 __

    Marker Size (edge length): __ 12.06 cms __

PROCEDURE

    1. Make sure camera is calibrated.
    2. Place AR marker in the field of view of camera (say position P1). Make sure marker ID is present in the config.json file.
    3. Create ACH channel to publish marker data.
        $ ach -C cam0_channel -o 666  -m 10 -n 64    

    4. Run camProcess. Make sure to set configuration parameters in camProces.cpp file. Using camera 0, 
        $ cd path/to/alvarCode
        $ ./bin/camProcess 0 0

    5. Note down x, y and z positions of the marker as shown by camProcess in the terminal window.
    6. Move the marker by 1 meter horizontally without changing the orientation and again note down the x, y and z positions.
    7. Raise the marker by some height. Again note down measured position.

    Notes: 
        1. Make sure the marker id used is in config.json file.
        2. Remember to change configuration settings corresponding to checkboard or marker during calibration and camProcess execution.

OBSERVATIONS

    Marker was kept on the table.

    Before displacing the marker (P1):
        x1 = __ -58.8 cms __
        y1 = __  7.0 cms __
        z1 = __ 133.2 cms __

    After displacing the marker horizontally by 1 meter (P2):
        x2 = __ 31.4 cms __
        y2 = __ 55.6 cms __
        z2 = __ 137.5 cms __

    After raising the marker (P3):

        Height raised : 40 cms
        x2 = __ 32.2 cms __
        y2 = __ 54.9 cms __
        z2 = __ 104.2 cms __

RESULTS

    Change in measured position from P1 to P2 = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
                                              = __ 102.45 cms __


    %age difference in actual and measured distance = (2.45/100)*100 % = __ 2.45 % __


    Change in measured height from P2 to P3 = z3 - z2
                                            = __ 33.3 cms __

    %age difference in actual and measured distance = (6.7/40)*100 % = __ 16.75 % __

CONCLUSION
    
    1. There is small difference between actual and measured distance in horizontal plane.
    2. There is large difference between actual and measured distance in the vertical direction.
