OBJECTIVE
  //  to be changed

    1. Test the variation of AR Marker detection confidence with distance of marker from the camera.

SETUP
    
    The camera is mounted from the roof facing downwards.

PROCEDURE

  //  to be changed

    1. Make sure camera is calibrated.
    2. Place AR marker in the field of view of camera horizontally. Make sure marker ID is present in the config.json file.
    3. Create ACH channel to publish marker data.
        $ ach -C cam0_channel -o 666  -m 10 -n 64 
        $ cd path/to/alvarCode   

    4. Run camProcess. Make sure to set configuration parameters in comProces.cpp file. Using camera 0,        
        $ ./bin/camProcess 0 0

    5. Note down the detection confidence value.
    6. Repeat above steps with marker at different heights.

    Notes: 
        1. Make sure the marker id used is in config.json file.
        2. Remember to change configuration settings corresponding to checkboard or marker during calibration and camProcess execution.
